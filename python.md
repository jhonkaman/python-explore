I'm working on a series of Python examples. For each h2 below, I want you to create a folder. In each folder, create 1 Python file for each item in the list. In each file, create 1 simple example that demonstrates the concept in the list. After finishing 1 item in the list, pause and check in with me before continuing. Don't add numbers to the folders or file names. Also, create a todo list so I can follow your progress.
